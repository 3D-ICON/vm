### FAQ

> ##### How to use this thing?
> To start using the SQF-VM, you just have to double click the executable.
> ##### What can it be used for (examples)?
> Most obvious example is: you are using a laptop while traveling and wanna test some SQF code.
> More advanced users might even use this for unit-testing their code.
> ##### Are there command line parameters available to eg. use this for unit-testing?
> Yes, there are. To get all, start the tool via command line and the parameter -?
> ##### I entered SQF with invalid syntax and the VM is outputting gibberish
> The SQF-VM project is not aiming to do any actual syntax checking.
> The tool expects valid SQF as input and invalid syntax might result in invalid execution stacks.
> ##### I found a bug, what shall i do now?
> First of all: if it is due to invalid syntax not getting reported correctly, nothing.
> After that: Ensure all commands used are actually supported in your SQF-VM version using the help command
> If it is not caused due to invalid syntax or a missing command in the SQF-VM, try to narrow down the problem as much as you can and then head over to the github issues section to report the bug.
> The only exception to the above is a crash! Crashes you always can report :)
